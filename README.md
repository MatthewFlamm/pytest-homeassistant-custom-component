# pytest-homeassistant-custom-component

![HA core version](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=HA+core+version&message=2021.4.0b4&labelColor=blue)

Package to automatically extract testing plugins from Home Assistant for custom component testing.
The goal is to provide the same functionality as the tests in home-assistant/core.

## Usage:
* All pytest fixtures can be used as normal, like `hass`
* For helpers:
  * home-assistant/core native test: `from tests.common import MockConfigEntry`
  * custom component test: `from pytest_homeassistant_custom_component.common import MockConfigEntry`
* If your integration is inside a `custom_components` folder, a `custom_components/__init__.py` file or changes to `sys.path` may be required.
* If using `load_fixture`, the files need to be in a `fixtures` folder colocated with the tests. For example, a test in `test_sensor.py` can load data from `some_data.json` using `load_fixture` from this structure:

```
tests/
   fixtures/
      some_data.json
   test_sensor.py
```

## Examples:
* See [list of custom components](https://github.com/MatthewFlamm/pytest-homeassistant-custom-component/network/dependents) as examples that use this package.
* Also see tests for `simple_integration` in this repository.
* Use [integration-blueprint](https://github.com/custom-components/integration_blueprint) as a template to create your custom component. A basic test suite is already implemented.
* Use [cookiecutter-homeassistant-custom-component](https://github.com/oncleben31/cookiecutter-homeassistant-custom-component) to create a custom component similar to integration_blueprint but customized for you by using [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).
* The [github-custom-component-tutorial](https://github.com/boralyl/github-custom-component-tutorial) explaining in details how to create a custom componenent with a test suite using this package.

## More Info
This repository is set up to be nearly automatic with the goal of being fully automatic.
To keep the releases up to date, a PR is automatically generated with new changes biweekly.
After manually merging the PR, a second action is manually run to bump the version, make a release, and upload to PyPI.

* Version of home-assistant/core (dev branch) is given in `pytest_homeassistant_custom_component.const` and in the README above.

This package was inspired by [pytest-homeassistant](https://github.com/boralyl/pytest-homeassistant) by @boralyl, but is intended to more closely and automatically track the home-assistant/core library.
