# This file is originally from homeassistant/core and modified by pytest-homeassistant-custom-component.
# linters such as flake8 and pylint should be pinned, as new releases
# make new things fail. Manually update these pins when pulling in a
# new version

# types-* that have versions roughly corresponding to the packages they
# contain hints for available should be kept in sync with them
